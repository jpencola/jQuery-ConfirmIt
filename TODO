TODO v.1.0
----------

BUGS:


TASKS:

	- (testing) cross-browser testing. Along with this, lets decide on our "A-grade" browsers.
	- (maintenance) add a build script for auto-generating the compressed/optimized JS file.
	- (housekeeping) in destroy(), in the condition of the "leave-confirm", we should unbind all the form element events that check for changes. 

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
	
	- Think about rules-style syntax support.
