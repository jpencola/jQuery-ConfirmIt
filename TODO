TODO v.1.0
----------

*Un-official TODO list*

- Fix the bug where subsequent calls to "init" from DOMInsert handler doesn't pass the proper options. Can be seen in "spawner" demo 
  if you change the "triggered_by" event to something other than "click".
  
- Check for matched selector when elements are added to the DOM (ie: spawner demo)

- Flesh out the README with "recipe" style examples

- Clean up the "showcase" page. 

- Add simple rules syntax for advanced (optional) confirmation determination.  

- Add a method to destroy the plugin
