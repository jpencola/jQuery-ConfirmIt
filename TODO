TODO v.1.0
----------

*Un-official TODO list*

- Decide how we want to approach late binding of events that should trigger confirmations. 
  For example, if someone instantiates ConfirmIt, but then later in the code binds the event that should trigger a confirmation.
  One approach would be to make the decision that the plugin must be made aware of that change in the code (ie: some sort of "refresh")
  Another approach could be that we listen for events at the Window level 

- Since we are in the context of jQuery, look at the viability of Defer: does it make sense? does it benefit us?

- Demonstrate additional events being confirmed:
	- link-out confirms
	- ...

- Flesh out the README with "recipe" style examples

- Evaluate any additional options we want to include in this version

- Add simple rules syntax for advanced (optional) confirmation determination.
