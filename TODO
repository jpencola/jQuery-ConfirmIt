TODO v.1.0
----------
  
BUGS:

	- Check for matched selector when elements are added to the DOM (ie: spawner demo)

TASKS:

	- Integrate LeavePage Form example to showcase.

	- Clean-up logic in ConfirmIt constructor. Particularly ln#174, it's getting to be unreadable.

ENHANCEMENTS:

	- Namespace the leavepage event like the others. Can we do this since it's not a jQuery event?
	
	- Think about rules-style syntax support.
