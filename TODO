TODO v.1.0
----------

*Un-official TODO list*

- Check for matched selector when elements are added to the DOM (ie: spawner demo)

- Since we are in the context of jQuery, look at the viability of Defer: does it make sense? does it benefit us?

- Flesh out the README with "recipe" style examples

- Clean up the "showcase" page. 

- Evaluate any additional options we want to include in this version

- Add simple rules syntax for advanced (optional) confirmation determination.  

- Add a method to destroy the plugin
