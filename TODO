TODO v.1.0
----------

*Un-official TODO list*

- Fix bug in the <body> event binding (DOMNodeInserted) where each intialization of ConfirmIt binds an additional event.

- Check for matched selector when elements are added to the DOM (ie: spawner demo)

- Flesh out the README with "recipe" style examples

- Clean up the "showcase" page. 

- Evaluate any additional options we want to include in this version

- Add simple rules syntax for advanced (optional) confirmation determination.  

- Add a method to destroy the plugin
