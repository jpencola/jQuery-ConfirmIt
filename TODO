TODO v.1.0
----------

*Un-official TODO list*
  
- Check for matched selector when elements are added to the DOM (ie: spawner demo)

- Flesh out the README with "recipe" style examples

- Clean up the "showcase" page. 

- Add simple rules syntax for advanced (optional) confirmation determination.  
  ** Consider how a rules engine may work to accomplish confirmation invocation for larger groupings of logic. For example the forms demo. 
  
- Add LeavePage example to showcase

- Namespace the leavepage event like the others. Can we do this since it's not a jQuery event?

- Clean-up logic in ConfirmIt constructor. Particularly ln#174, it's getting to be unreadable.
